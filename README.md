Hey Ayesha, hope u can tell ur brother to msg me. I think if a guy fucks a girl for 8 years where she tells him she loves him n wants to marry him every day, the least he can do is reply her msg when she reaches out, and when he gets engaged to the girl he talked to like 2 weeks after last fucking her. I think its just the very least one can do. Its a sin to waste this much time from a young woman, but God will deal with that one and I guess Usman doesn't know how to respect non-muslim women, its a shame. Anyway, otherwise there's a lot I could share with Neha and her family about him, but don't really want to unless I don't hear from him today. Appreciate it.
