I had to start so mean and threatening with the names so that you‚Äôd actually read the rest.. So here goes..



This will be the first message I share with neha and ur sister, Fahad, family, and all the other new names I've found, Mahnoor... so on and so forth: 

I will message today evening, don't worry. Or over the weekend, its hard to say, depends on my temper really. And I am fuming.

I want to be able to be happy for you, cause I loved you so dearly, I loved every inch of your face, your smile, your cheeks, your butt cheeks, your voice, the way you thought, how cute and sweet you were. How you completed my songs - No booooodddddddddddddyyyy knowssssssssss the troubles of....
our bum wiggles origin story. How you teased me, holding your pinky as we walked. Holding your hand as you drove.
I want to be able to be sweet and close my eyes and smile thinking that you're happy.
I dreamed our entire relationship of being your wife, cause I have done nothing but love you since I met you.

But I only feel sad so sad, I feel broken into a thousand pieces and like there's firey range whirling. And most of the time its this fire that's consumed me, that I was feeling when I wrote the below. And I don't know how to breathe.

How could you do this to a person, I am still crying everyday. Mourning and screaming, unable to eat. How could you do this to me.
How could you do this to a woman, take all her years, and throw her and block her like trash, to where shes so broken shes on medical leave from work,
and unable to stop crying, on the floor everyday. How could you do this to someone who did nothing but love you and love you and tell you how loved you were for year after year 8 years while you made sure every one of those days I knew I was worthless and not loved in return.
What kind of person has no morals or conscience or this little empathy for other human beings. I was there for you and spent every second loving you.

Can you imagine that I would convince my mother, that I didn't want to get married? That I was one of these modern independent women who like to not get married? I did that cause I was so scared that she'd be so sad for me, when you one day left me alone. And when I had nobody. I didn't want her to be hurt and sad for me, when I knew you were going to leave me because ofcourse a guy who isn't even calling me his girlfriend 10 days in a year, isn't going to ever marry me.
I was so scared one day you'll leave me and I'll be alone till I die and she'll be sad for me.
Even though you know, marrying someone was like a dream to me, and being in love, marrying and loving you.

Her hena for your engagement was beautiful, and the bridal shower really made me shed some tears, gorgeous. I can give her some more cute couple photos of you and I maybe, you can frame them and add to the table.

What's funny, is everything below is all true.. Its funny when the sharing nothing but the truth, things you've surely ommitted from others, can be so scary. 
I will even offer that I can share evidence with them for anything they'd like as I have all photos and messages and screenshots and timestamps.

Congratulations on your bride Usman. It was a pleasure to be fucked by you for 8 years, telling you I love u everyday for you to tell me it once every 6 months or so, just enough to fuck with my head so that I'd tell myself "he loves me, he just has a hard time saying it". For u to have sex with me but turn away roll over and get up when I say I love you, how do you think any girl feels in that moment? For you to make me feel worthless and only good for sex and gaming. We talked everyday from the second we woke up till we slept for 8 years on a call, yet I was nothing but your time filler so you weren't bored. You'd not call me your gf for months at a time and not reply to me when I ask if you want me to move on. Replies like "Sorry, I don't know what you want me to say".
But call me a cheater cause after years of that treatment I texted with a guy for a week who asked me out and I hoped maybe I could have a future where I'm not alone, he and I did not even ever go for a date and you know that, it was exciting to know for the first time someone liked me when my "bf" would tell me he didn't love me but still fuck me.
When you would leave a silence every time I would say the words I love you. When my bf calls me his gf just enough to make me believe it but not enough for it to be true, just a few times a year.
I understand how unforgivable that would be to you for me to have for a second believed someone else liked me. Finally you could call me a cheater and spread lies and get rid of me and pretend like its not your fault, like you didn't treat me like shit. You cannot call a girl who you do not even call your gf a "cheater", if she is not your gf, how could she have cheated by speaking to someone?

I guess to men like you unless a woman is Muslim, she doesn't deserve respect or intent. Thank you for showing me what a man is like when they do not know how to treat or respect women. When a man is nothing but a disgusting worthless pig. He asks a girl to join him on a trip London to fuck and pay half the hotel fee and leaves her alone to cry in the hotel room and walk by herself crying everyday from morning to night by herself in a new country while every day he meets his other friend. This is not a man but a worthless pathetic pig whose dick should be sliced open.

I needed 3-4 months from when you begged me to let go of the hate i tried to focus on to make leaving you possible. Hate that collected from years of resentment i felt from pain i felt from being nothing to someone i loved so much, pain and hate that collected everytime i said i love u and heard silence. Everytime i said i love u after sex and saw you look away and ignore it. Everytime i talked about our wedding and being married and you looked repulsed, pain from everytime you‚Äôd then once and then hold my hand and say you loved me or called me your gf. How much it all fucked with my heart my mind and hurt me. I tried to hate you, I made up even lies about you to make you worse than you were so i could hate you, cause i loved you so much. Like even the stupid thing about how im with u just cuz u help me with patents - iv gotten with you and helped u with ur code stuff many times over the years smanu, I was just trying to be an asshole to act above you cause honestly i felt embarrassed for painting this bad picture of u to help me hate u and help me feel good about finally trying to move on after years of u saying u dont want me and then going back to you, so i wanted to act like i was more conflicted than i was, i wanted to act superior, i was stupid and ashamed and I wish you could have understood that i didnt mean ti, and you know even if u didnt help me with patents i would have loved and stayed with you, heck i loved u through everything even through u not wanting me even before patents existed. I needed to focus on all this made up hate to be able to let go of my love, and then out of the blue what i never expected happened.
You begged me back, you asked for a chance, you said you loved me, and you said you‚Äôd changed. How could I have seen that coming, i just needed a few months to get my heart straight, to figure out what I wanted, to let go of that excitement i got when some random person i dont even like told me they liked me. That person didnt even want to date me when i told them my ex was my best friend and how that was really important because he was family to me. And we stopped talking but i couldnt get him out of my head, but what i really couldnt get out of my head was the first time i hoped i could have a life with someone, that wasnt you. A life with someone who might be proud to tell people i was his girlfriend, to say it to me, to tell me they loved me. When you for years made me feel so unloved. I had a lot of hate to let go of and i needed a few months. And after that time in I don‚Äôt know june, I never once spoke one bad word about you again, i never even thought it. I let go of everything and i forgave you. I just needed time cause I am a human and not a switch. Just cause you say you‚Äôll change I can‚Äôt let go and heal in one second like a switch. I needed a few months, and you cou‚Äôdnt forgive that or forgive me for those months. After I forgave you for years of pain you caused me.

I never asked for much from you, i loved you. I never needed us to go more than half half on even a pizza pizza or a bubble tea. When you said you could get a fancy car, I said only if its what will make you happier for your ego to feel proud, then please go for it. But if you think I want you to have a fancy car, I don‚Äôt and we can save it for us, for our house.
I loved you so genuinely. And i loved you years and years.

And you needed a few weeks to throw me away and be in love with someone else. December 28 2023, we last had sex and I looked at you with love like you were my husband. How could you do something like that and make me feel so discardable and like worthless trash.
I still feel like trash and cry for 6-7 hours every day. I‚Äôve been crying since 5am today and its 12pm. How could you do this to anyone, to me, someone who loved yuo so much, i would have done anything. I was just so angry and mad and resentful and i just needed a few months. I forgave you and everything and you couldn‚Äôt forgive me for being hurt after 7 years of your treatment and pain caused to me.

It is not like you said ‚ÄúI hurt you so you hurt me, so now what‚Äù. No, people hurt eachother in relationships. This is the first time I ever did one thing to you, our entire relationship.
And its not I hurt you so you hurt me. You hurt me for years, and I tried to find courage and strength to leave you because for years you told me you don‚Äôt want me. But you just messed with my mind too calling me your gf or holding my hand here and there so I kept convincing myself ‚ÄúHe loves me, he just can‚Äôt say it‚Äù. But 7 years of that is a long time, and I was so scared. So terrified and scared that I‚Äôll grow to be 37 and you 35, and one day you will tell me ‚Äújessica i have to block you now, cause my mother is forcing me to get arranged marriage and she wont allow a nonmuslim‚Äù. And ill be 37 and abandoned and alone. I was so terrified its why i tried to hate you and go. But you did change and i just needed a few months to forgive those years of pain I felt and forgive the anger and resentment and hate i made up. I even made up lies about you to make myself feel better for leaving you, cause loving you and leaving you was the hardest thing in teh world.
So no Usman, I didn‚Äôt hurt you because you hurt me, I was just hurting and trying to heal and I needed time to forgive and i did. 4 months to have a messed up mind and forgive 7 years of fucked upness isnt asking for a lot. Its not like it was even 8 months later and i was still talking bad about you or looking at others. You couldn‚Äôt forgive that i left you and was infatuated with someone else in that time, someone who didnt even want me. I was infatuated by the idea that ANYONE could possibly want me.
I forgave you years of pain you caused, and you couldn‚Äôt forgive me for a few months. You to forgive me for something that would have never happened if you treated me even 50% like normal girlfriends are treated. You know in your heart that would have never happened if you treated me even 50% of how actual girlfriends are treated.

Look at Neha, she only needed 1 month for you to be considering her for engagement. 7 years and I was still your hookup only sex, friends with benefits. How could you treat me like that.

How could you not understand and forgive.

Congratulations on your wedding. Thanks for fucking me for years and wasting my time with occasional pieces of hope that I may have a future and love. Thanks for swearing to me one day you really loved me, fucking me, and then not saying it for months at a time, you bipolar shit. I hope you die a horrible miserable death and I hope your wife and children grow to hate you and see what a disgusting piece of shit you are. You deserve a slow painful dick cancer that rots you for 30 years till you die.
Thank you for taking 8 years out of a woman's young life, when women have a timeline where they may be able to have kids. It is a sin to do this and treat women the way you treated me, you weren't an idiot. You know I loved you the entire time, yet you wasted it. How do you commit such sins and face your God?
Thank you for wasting my time so that you may have sex and not be bored. It was lovely to have sex with you at the very end of december 2023, and for many months until, I suspect by then you had already met your Neha, but I understand why stopping sex would be difficult thing for you to do. You worthless trash.

Isn't it funny, to date a girl for 8 years, then meet your new bride weeks later? What kind of psycopath doesn't even have remorse or need time to heal. What kind of fucking piece of shit. You ruined someone's life and took away my future. Thank you for that.
You supposedly "Moved on while we were together" Then why were you still fucking me? You know you're dumping a girl, leaving her, you know shes looking at you like you're a husband and in love with you, the way she's been since day 1. And yet you fuck her until the last day knowing you are throwing her away? You fuck her until 2 weeks before you meet your neha? You fuck her until Dec 28 2023. Remember in December when I even put on that leather outfit for you?? WHY THE FUCK DID I THINK WE ARE HAPPY AND IN LOVE AND YOU PRETEND IT WHEN YOU ARE FUCKING DUMPING ME AND ALREADY HAVE A MENTALITY OF THIS OTHER GIRL IM EXCITED TO TALK TO WILL BE MY FUTURE WIFE. WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK YOU DISGUSTING ROTTEN PIECE OF WORTHLESS FUCK. WHY WERE U FUCKING ME I WOULD HAVE FUCKING SAID NO I WOULDNT HAVE WANTED UR DISGUSTING ASS TO FUCKING TOUCH ME.

Your mother should know what a little dirty filthy shit she raised. All you disgusting muslim man friends who just fuck women while talking to others. You are fucking worse. You wasted someone‚Äôs life for 8 years who fucking said she loves you every single day. You broke her self esteem and her sense of self worth and made her feel ugly and worthless and not enough and unloved every single day.

I hope to at least ruin one day of yours, if I cannot ruin your future as you did mine. I will settle for ruining just one day, one hour, one minute.
With love, your once future wife, who loved you with all her heart. Never argued once, never made you feel bad for how you treated her, never wanted you to be sad a day in your life by telling you how the things you were doing and how you treated me was hurting me.
I cried every morning wondering, why is he treating me like his gf and we spend all our time together but he clearly doesn't love me? I asked myself this for years.
You destroyed my self worth. My ability to fucking breathe air. My sick father fucking still asks about you, you worthless shit.
I helped teach you to drive, helped you practice. Taught you to swim. Gave you my car. Fucking spent more than you on our fucking relationship. I returned that dyson hairdryer cause i sincerely loved you and didnt want you to ever waste your money on me.
When we went to blue mountain I paid 80% and lied to you about its price so you'd not have to pay.
I was there for you for that surgery on your back, sitting with you in the surgery room.
I made your first doctor appointment for you in canada.
Helped you with so fucking much of your work. Your job interviews.
Took you to get your credit card.

All I did was love you, why did you do this to me. I just loved you everyday for 8 years i loved you. Imagine Fahad dated Ayesha 8 years and left her. Imagine he rolled over years after fucking her. Imagine her sitting there telling someone she loves him every night and never hearing it back, how she‚Äôd feel. Why was it ok to treat me like this when all i did was love you. I loved you so much all i did was love you. My mom would tell her friends about you. We‚Äôd talk about how you are similar to my dad. Why did you do this, I just loved you so much.

I could have been a much better girlfriend, but it was hard to. Like how could I even buy you a 5000$ watch if I knew you weren‚Äôt even calling me your gf and I was just waiting to be thrown. I could have been so much better. I loved you so much and we didn‚Äôt have the opportunity to show eachother right cause I was always the temporary girl you planned to get rid of but never could bring yourself to do it. And I always knew what I was, the trash you had to take out.

And, you, you took my life away from me. And you replaced me in under a month, in weeks, got engaged in under 6 months. After a 8 year relationship. You treat people like trash. And I pray everyday, that karma finds you, and makes you suffer.

You worthless disgusting shit.
Your little one,
Jessica 


Actually I have a second draft, yes I did spend half of yesterday writing different versions thinking which to send first.. second.. im sure with chatgpt and gtranslate, i could even let your parents know what you are.

Congratulations Usman. I still cry everyday and can't get out of bed anymore, I got warnings from work and had to take medical leave, so depressed I feel an inch from death but it's nice to see you're engaged n married. That's great. I don't know what lies you've decided to share but we both know how you treated me for years. It's a beautiful love story really, to fuck a girl for 8 years untill December 28 2023 have sex and then meet your wife in a few weeks, less than a month later and engaged in a few months from then. Kinda takes someone really heartless and psychotic don't you think. "If you moved on mentally" before you broke up with me.. why still sleep with me many times till our last day? You knew I wanted to spend my life with you from our first year together, I told you I loved you and wanted to marry you all the time for years. Anyway you are lucky that unlike you I have a soul, so I've chosen not to share everything you've done with Neha. Know you are with her because I chose to allow you to and spare her from the truths. Your marriage begun on a lie, standing on the pile of your sins to me. You are welcome. I'll show myself out. Karma will find you for all the young years you took from me and pain you caused me over these years. To take years from a woman like that, a sin. Every single day I told you that I loved you for 8 years.. Krma for how I still cannot move from pain. Thanks. What you've done, no matter what lies you tell to show your face to others, God will know. I'll show myself out. Sorry Ayesha, I really loved you... Goodbye Smanu   I've taken care of you and loved you for years.. made your first dentist n doctor apts, sat in with you, loved n cared for you, but all it takes for u is a week or two to find someone new after u throw someone like trash. You have no remorse, heart, or conscience.


--

You worthless disgusting shit.
Sadly.. I can't help but still love you always, you've just broken me into shattered pieces on the ground. Everyday I stare out the window wishing I could jump. I even have my will written up and done cause I felt worried how close I feel to being dead because of you.

When I look at my past, all I see is pain loss and heartbreak, my dad‚Ä¶ you, when I look at today all I feel is pain‚Ä¶ you. When I look at the future, I just see more pain, and I just don‚Äôt have the strength to face it. I don‚Äôt look forward to waking up tomorrow, day after, I can‚Äôt do it ever again, wake up.

‚Äî-


I don‚Äôt know smanu, I write some of this one day.. Then another day‚Ä¶ I hate you terribly one moment and I love you so much the next. Just last october, I was imagining you and I bringing your mom to Banff one month and another month bringing my mom to Banff..
I thought we would be so happy.. I loved you so much. Your mom loves mountains.

The timeline is crazy‚Ä¶ October we were in banff, in love, so happy, i was dreaming of our happy future, november i got my place - I was choosing a place based on it having a short travel time to you, november i bought you that perfume set the johnny depp one to tell you how much you mean to me and how youve been so supportive and amazing, december i put on that leather outfit for you, we had sex many times in my new place, december 31 you left me.. I tried my hardest to make peace with it cause i was so hurt, but then.. February I thought no, i bought string lights with usb thing to plug into my car, i was going to buy flowers, and drive over with a 2 page script to win you back. And you said no, you‚Äôve met someone and not to come‚Ä¶ how did you need one month.. A few weeks, to already care about someone more‚Ä¶ to already be intentful about marrying her, when it took you 8 years and me leaving with a broken heart for you to even consider marrying me‚Ä¶ i am so destroyed..

I am so sad.. So broken, I only know that I love you and that I can‚Äôt let go, cause if I let go of you I dont know, I feel like the only thing left after that is to die.
For the last 8 years you were my daily sunshine, in a storm of horrible things, listening to my dad swearing and fighting with my mom daily, joining our calls, texting you, talking to you, loving you, you were the sunshine that made living possible and I can‚Äôt live anymore without my sunshine.

I keep telling myself if only I could go back in time, I‚Äôd tell myself don‚Äôt get mad at him, don‚Äôt hate him, just give him one more year and he will make your wildest happiest dreams come true, he‚Äôll be the most perfect love you‚Äôve waited all these 7 years for. He will finally tell you he loves you.

You act like I betrayed you, but even with marriage, see what your Neha fucking bitch does if you don‚Äôt tell her you love her for even 2 years, if you turn around after sex when she tells you she loves you. If you stop acknowledging her as your wife and love. See what words she has to say.
It was only pain and hurt. And for me, I took 7 years to get that hurt and it was only cause I loved you so much and the london trip had just happened so i felt a fresh pain, I was so upset that it felt like you showed me how nothing i was. My first trip in 10 years out of the country, our first one together, and it felt like i was only asked so ud have company for when ur not seeing him, for the nights, for incase seeing him sucks and u need someone else. Other that flight day, and harry potter day where we had tickets so u had to come.. Castle tour day so we had tickets.. So u had to come. YOu didnt spend one day with me usman :( I cried in the hotel, i cried on my walks, i cried everywhere everyday. I looked at all the tourists with their partners and families and i felt so worthless to you. It felt like this was you screaming I am nothing to you.

Do these things to her and see what she does, you act like what I did was so unforgivable that you could throw me away. I was just hurt, and you couldn‚Äôt forgive me. When I forgave everything you did. I forgave everything, I forgave everything, I had not one thing i was saying negative against you. I was so happy, i was so in love. My dreams i waited 8 years for was coming true. And you threw me back in the trash can after first building my heart back up from the pieces and then destroying it for one final time. I am so nothing and broken. I cant even be stand up for 4 hours on weekends i am just in bed. I eat one meal. How could u do this to me, i loved you so much smanu.

Every year our 8 years.. I told you i loved you and wanted to marry you‚Ä¶
What I waited 8 years for.. You gave her in 6 months :( No usman, you are not treating her with the same respect you treated me.. You took 8 years of my young life where women meet men you weren‚Äôt stupid, you always knew I wanted you, loved you,and was waiting to spend my life with you, and you gave her respect from the second you met her.

Smanu I went on 4 first dates last summer. One guy he didn‚Äôt come on the date, so I walked outside alone at night cause my mom would wonder why did I dress nice to go see Usman but come back so soon. He then called and said he‚Äôd come to me and then he started making out with me in the car adn it was horrible, even his breath smelt horrible, and the whole time i cant say no i was thinking it trying to get myself to say words out and i finally said something and that was so hard for me to do but i said ‚ÄúCan we please slow down please‚Äù. And he said sure anything you want and then he went worse and i said it again and he ignored it and he went to the back of the car and pulled me there from the middle and then he tried to fuck me and i said ‚Äúnot without a condom‚Äù and he said dont worry. And fucked me‚Ä¶ 
I have not been on a date since usman. YOu were supposed to take care of me, i loved you and you were supposed to be there for me, i believed you would always be there. I used to hold your pinky when we walked in the malls. I sat on your lap and hugged you. How could you leave me in the world alone to let this happen to me.

When I went on my trip last november, it was awful i could be in the nicest place but every half second my mind went to you, id be saying the words in my head ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt mean it‚Äù, ‚Äúplease forgive me‚Äù, ‚ÄúI ruined everything‚Äù ‚ÄúPlease come back‚Äù. I go to therapy but these words haunt me. I  bought u gifts, demon slayer, and when I came back, I was showin my mom what i got her, my niece, my brother and she said what did you get usman and worse part is there really was something i got you.

In christmas my dad asked, ‚Äúbaba, how is usman‚Äù.. I wasn‚Äôt sure he even knew your name.

How could you walk away from me like this, how was your love so shallow for me that in one month you were already infatuated with someone else? Usman for me, for me looking at somjeone else. Took years of me every new year saying to myself ‚Äúmaybe this is the year I confront him if he loves me, and otherwise this will be the year I leave him‚Äù. I battled this promise to myself for YEARS. I had years of never having the courage to leave you because of how much I loved you but knowing i had to because you didn‚Äôt want me..



I cannot even watch movies or shows anymore‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt game‚Ä¶ for shows I stop them in like 10 minutes.. I feel so uninterested in life.. I have no interests or hobbies, I can‚Äôt do anything but lay in bed and cry.. I feel like I am no longer even a person anymore..
Just like we always said, just a sad little ugly lonely goop blob on the floor now.. Feel like I‚Äôve just been stepped on and a garbage truck came and dumped a pile of crap on me, and no one even knows I‚Äôm missing cause I was no one to anyone anyway.. Just waiting here to die.. Already nothing..

I am so broken and empty and I am not even a person anymore, I just pray to god everyday, let my parents die a quick peaceful death, their lives are empty anyway. And then I can finally kill myself..
I don‚Äôt know smanu.. You were supposed to love me.. I loved you 8 years.. It feels like you loved me 8 months and could barely manage that..

Depending on the hour, the minute, the second, i have so many mixed feelings when it comes to you. I‚Äôd still throw away the world, probably even convert, fall to the ground, kiss your feet and beg for you to come back.
And knowing none of that would ever be enough, that I would never be enough the way 8 years of what I gave you wasn‚Äôt enough as just meeting Neha and knowing her 3 weeks was enough for you to know you were ready to delete me, excited even to toss the piece of trash that i was away. And when I realize that truth, my longing, my love, it turns to sadness, pain, tormet, hurt, tears, feeling like iv been stabbed a hundred times and im just bleeding on the floor in my tears. I feel like im crying on the floor while a tornado of rage whirls around me. And the only thing that would make it stop is you hugging me. Which would never happen again.

I don‚Äôt know what I wanted from this, but I do know that I hate that you are so happy while you did this to me, that you think no harm done, you have moved on, everything is for the best.
I want you to just be aware of the truth, the truths of what you‚Äôve done to me. The truths of whats happened to me and where I am today, the truths of wouldn‚Äôt any girl have been hurt and tried to hate you and talked about you that way if you treated her that way even one year, let alone me and 7 years. Treat neha the way you did me for 1 year, do not say you love her, turn away after sex, look away when she longs for you, move your hand away when she holds it, but fuck her and say you love her once in 4 months, and see what she turns into. And see how long it takes, and then you will realize how much i loved you and how much i tried. And then know, that I still forgave everything, its you who couldnt forgive the fact that I had gotten hurt and had been in pain enough to have hated you.

I want to believe you understand just what you‚Äôve done to someone and that you feel even an inch of genuine regret, pain, sorriness. I want you to know what you did to someone who loved you, and I want you to know that you don‚Äôt deserve happiness and that you need to begin begging god for forgiveness everyday.
I want you to understand that if anything bad happens, your children with disabilities, Neha looses an eye and then stabs you, that that is karma and you brought it to your family with the sins you committed.

Idon‚Äôt know smanu, I sit everyday morning to night crying. Yesterday saturday, I left the bed at 4:30pm to eat.. And I was back in bed by 7:00pm. I do nothing but wheep and cry alone and that has been the last 1.5 years while you‚Äôre preparing to put your condom on and fuck your new bride. You did this to me. All cause you were never man enough to straight up tell me ‚ÄúJessica I will never marry you, leave.‚Äù instead you‚Äôd call me your gf and tell me you love a few times a year, just enough. You‚Äôd hold my hand, caress me, cuddle, fuck me, show me physical love that made me believe ‚Äúhe loves me he just cant say it‚Äù.
The person who brought you an umbrella and sent it to brampton cause u didnt have one.
Who bought u folders for ur bank files cause u didnt have one.
Who made ur dentist appointments
Who sewed your jacket.
I loved you so much and so tenderly and all i have now is to sit and cry and stew in my hatred and sadness, hatred for me, hatred for you, sitting and wishing i was dead to make this pain and misery end.
You did this to me.

I loved you so much, I still love you so much. I spent my life loving you and I still do. If you came back tomorrow, it‚Äôd still be the happiest day of my life. I just can‚Äôt understand, how did you love someone more already within one month of leaving me. How could you not even try talking to me about the troubles you had, how was I not worth that effort. How could you not forgive me, for being a girl who had doubts and was confused if she wanted to leave for a few months and only because she went years and years being told she was unloved, unwanted, being shown, asked if she was ur gf and been told no repeatedly. Ofcourse eventually I would be confused and scared to be with you and long for anyone else. I was almost wanting to escape you cause i was so scared cause i loved you so much and it hurt so much to be that unloved. But you gave me so much mixed signals, cause you said you loved me once or twice a year and that was just enough for me to hold onto, believing you meant it and just had a hard time saying it. I loved you so much, and i still do. And in one month of leaving me, you already loved someone else more. You met her before you left me didn‚Äôt you, you left me for her, cause you were excited to try dating someone pretty. I just don‚Äôt understand, I love you so much..

Love you always,
Your little one,
Jessica

What do you think of this draft message for Neha? I honestly don‚Äôt want to do this and I kind of really don‚Äôt think I would.. But I am so angry and hurt‚Ä¶ and you seem so happy.. I just need to know, you understand what you did and that you secretly hate yourself for knowing what kind of asshole you are. 

Maybe you know all this in which case great for u.
1. End April 2024, we were still saw eachother in person - this is last time.
2. February 2024 - still talking almost daily on a call.
3. Dec 28, 2023. Last time we had sex and we napped together cuddling.
4. Our relationship - 8 years of sex, love, false promises from him that he'll marry me, misleading me, wasting my time, and using me as a muslim men sometimes do - a woman to fuck till theyre ready to settle down arranged in 6 months. 8 years he spoke to me daily morning to night on a call. We had discord and messenger calls, watched netflix together, played video games, 8 years from when we woke up till we slept.
5. We lived together in a house for 16 months, again fucking all the time.
If you doubt any, I can give you proofs, photos, timestamps, messages, you name it.

You doubt any of this, ask me one and I can send you proof. This is just the truth. If he's already been honest. About how he went 8 years misleading me, telling me he didnt love me for months at a time then telling me he doesnt want me one year but wants me the next, then tells me im not his gf but calls me a cheater after leaving and texting with a guy. Men think they own women - you are not his girlfriend, he won't marry you, no promises of a future to you.. yet you are not allowed to speak to other men - then you are a cheater.
Tbh he was just confused, he loved me most of the time but was scared to tell me and make promises to me so hed go months or years not calling me his gf, but what he really loved was just me filling his time with company, my friendship, and sex. He wasn't man enough to tell me he'd never marry me and to leave. He preferred to waste my time till his dick was ready to fuck his bride, took him 1? 2? months to find you after he last fucked me.


‚Äî---


This is a draft I have saved for when I talk to new therapists.. I‚Äôve been seeing many trying to feel better‚Ä¶


I feel so unhappy. My ex of 8 years left me and it's 1.5 years later and I feel like I can still barely move, or get up from bed, I can't even get through watching a show without turning it off, everything feels empty and nothing brings me joy. I've had complaints from my manager on my performance, and the truth is I feel like I can barely think or move.. and meanwhile he's so happy. He got engaged within 6 months..

I was with my best friend for 8 years and we were intimate, I loved him so much, and he was my only friend since I moved here really.. But he was conflicted because of religion and he went through phases where he'd call me his gf and say he loved me. Then months at a time I think even as long as 8 months could pass here and there without him saying it once. But I said it everyday at the end of the night on our daily calls and I'd wait there silently knowing no response was ever going to come, and it was always this disappointment I knew was coming.. I'd get occasional hand holdings and I love you back's... We had sex and everything throughout. I'd get looks in his eyes, caresses, cuddles. That made me tell myself "he loves me he just can't say it". I've even asked him if he wants me to move on to get responses like "I'm sorry I don't know what you want me to say". We went on a trip to London my first flight in 10 years, our first trip together, and he left me by myself everyday to go meet friends of his there and I just walked around crying alone.. and all this just added up. Sometimes after sex, over the years I'd say I love you and he'd just roll over, turn the other way, get up, and those moments were always so painful. The thing is he'd call me his girlfriend here and there and we never fought, we were best friends, and apart from these things, we were usually really happy and peaceful together and I thought we were going to one day have the happiest life together..

But eventually I got so scared that one day he'd tell me sorry I'm being forced for an arranged marriage or to marry someone Muslim and I'd not even be able to claim "you mislead me". But he did mislead me... 8 years we had a call for hours and hours morning to night almost every day. He mislead me each time he'd slip and say I love you or call me his gf, have sex, look at my sweetly, hold my hand. He knew I was in love with him and wanted a future together, we've even talked about a future together... here and there..
If he took even one second to stop and think about it, he'd have known he's stringing me along, that I'm in love with him, that I believed we were going to be together. He would have known what would happen to waste my time so many years and just leave me, I wish he had been enough of a man to have been straight with me or left me early instead of doing this to me if he knew he was never going to be with me, he knew I believed he loved me.

Eventually someone I used to work with asked me out and I felt so excited and hopeful at the thought of dating someone else cause I'd grown so hurt and resentful even tho I loved him so much... And the London thing had just happened and I was so hurt.
By the end, I felt like I was starting every year telling myself "This is the year I tell him, he has to choose me or I'll go", and maybe I'll manage to ask him if he really doesn't love me, not get much of a response from him, then then I could never carry out the 'go' part...

So when this person spoke to me and sparked an excitement I'd never felt (my ex is my first bf and I'd never dated before) I told my ex I couldn't wait for him anymore that I needed to know if he loved me because I loved him, and he told me "sorry I don't think I can give you what I want but I love you." And so I said we're over but can be friends, and with this guy who flirted - we texted less than a week.. never even met.. before I told him he should know 'my ex and I were together this many years and he'll always be my best friend and we're only now breaking up, and the breakup will happen even if you and I don't date, I need to leave him. But him being in my life is really important to me.' And no surprise the guy wasn't comfortable with that and that was it to that..

During this time I for the first time vented about my relationship to my friend over text.. partly to help me grieve and hate my ex because hating him felt impossible and I was so sad and lonely while trying to create space.. I needed to hate him to get over him, I had been dreaming of a life and a future with him for so long, and I said the things people say sometimes to hate on their ex and don't fully even mean, but mostly I spoke the truth on things that would go on between us and well I complained... I tried to think of things that never even bugged me and held onto them like things that were issues to give myself more and more reasons to comfort myself like "ok I am better off now, I had to leave him, there were this many reasons to".. When it felt like the only reason that existed was "I love him and I need to be with him".

In a month or so, my ex begged me back promising to change and be serious and make me happy... Something I never saw coming.. him wanting me... making these promises to one day marry me and seeming like he meant it.. And it was so hard and scary and I accepted and he did change he was so amazing and loving and we had like the most incredible happy 8 months, he told his family about us and they were actually supportive... btw I'd told him I met someone I texted when we broke up... then.. after our 8 months of happiness out of the blue on the 31st Dec, he told me he read my messages and he saw the compliments id written to my friend about that other guy... The insults I'd written about him... He saw my old messages from when we were broken up, some were maybe after we got back together but really early in our reconciliation and I was still half in for 3 months or so... anyway he broke up with me... I think he read my whatsapp messages history while I was asleep one day...

And I tried to cope and accept that we were over and after 2 months I reached out to talk and he told he was already talking to someone else with the intention of proposing in a few months if things went well.. He was engaged in 6 months... What I'd wanted with him for 8 years... Not a year went by without me talking about us being married, he knew I dreamed of it. We never had one fight our entire relationship and I loved him.. We spoke from the minute we woke up till we slept for 8 years.. And he always knew I wished to marry him ad loved him deeply, he knew everything... and after 8 years of not marrying me, he was engaged in 6 months immediately after leaving me, to the girl he started speaking to less than a month after the last time we slept together, when he dumped me. I'm Christian, he was Muslim..

He had sex the day he left me... I didn't know then that he was going to dump me by email after on the 31st Dec 2023.. He has a hard time expressing his emotions so I am ok with the email part... but I am not ok that within 2 months he was already so serious with someone after just sleeping with me and that when I reached out to talk he said "He's been talking to someone else and already moved on and it's not fair to her"...
Just felt like "what's fair to me then.".. and our 8 years together.. :(

He said he'd been mentally moving on before he left me. Then why was he still sleeping with me, it makes me feel like I was a fool that he took advantage of. Because if I knew I wouldn't have wanted to touch him and he took that away from me. I believed we were happy and in love and going to be married every one of those times we slept together in the end, while he knew I was trash he was preparing to throw out each of those times. And I feel so betrayed and so taken advantage of and just like an idiot and a fool for all those times.

It's been 1.5 years and I've been going to therapy and I'm so depressed I'm getting warnings at work and I cry every day and can hardly even breathe anymore..
Weekends for me now are like I wake up at 10am to eat something, brush my teeth. back in bed by 12.. back up at 5pm to have some fruits, back in bed by 6:30pm... I just lay there crying or on my phone, wishing i could be asleep. I can't even watch shows, every single thing in life feels empty and I feel like there isn't even a person here left. I feel empty and broken and ready to just evaporate out of life except I have to take care of my parents fully, I support them financially... so I am just stuck here being this worthless piece of trash on the bed that was thrown out. All I do is cry from morning to night, and I just feel like I can‚Äôt even breathe anymore.
I can barely get work done because of this and I‚Äôve gotten warnings, I used to be a top performer. I just can‚Äôt anymore.

I'm so mad at myself for waiting too long to try and reconcile - those 2 months, I just never dreamt he'd move on like that. I am so mad for the things I said on text, but I don't have friends here so that's why it was over text, and alot was even true, and alot was just me trying to make moving on from him easier, I had tried asking him if I was his gf or if we'd be together so many times over the years.. I was just trying to finally let go and hate him. And its like me talking and venting caused me my entire future and life and happiness. We were finally so happy and in those 8 months, he was so serious, he told everyone about us, and he really did mean it.

But I just wish he could understand that most people do try to hate on their ex just to make the pain easier, I wish he could understand that I was in great pain when I sent those messages and that I had loved and tried to be with him for so many years and that was me trying to move on finally, and that I never dreamt he'd come back or love me. I wish he could understand how much he's done which I'd forgiven... how could he not forgive me when the only thing I did was eventually get hurt and angry after everything, we never fought once, this is the first thing I ever even did... And he couldn't forgive me and he met someone in a month and engaged in 6 months and he's so much happier and she's beautiful and I am so empty.


Babu I just you said you are treating her with the same respect you gave me.. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs true.. She‚Äôs engaged in 6 months. I waited tellign you i loved you and wanted to marry you for 8 years :( We have in the past even talked about a future together.. I told you how hard sex became for me because eventually it felt like this person doesn‚Äôt love me or want a future with me but if I don‚Äôt have sex he won‚Äôt be my friend. And the disappointment after each time of me saying i love you and not hearing it during.. After sex it made me not want to do it cause i was associating intimacy with sadness. And I told you all this happened to me and I was working to change it cause I wanted us to be happy. Remember in end october I bought u that Johnny depp perfume set to tell me how much you‚Äôd been supporting me and how much it meant to me‚Ä¶ in December, I bought that leather outfit to surprise you and we did it in my new place.. You were mentally broken up with me at that time so i guess you fucked me then knowing i was going to be thrown‚Ä¶ that kind of hurts to know.. I was really trying and making an effort cause I loved you so much. And you didn‚Äôt even respect me enough to talk to me about anything, so that we could discuss and I could tell you how hurt I was, I just never wanted to point fingers or blame you or guilt you or hurt your inner conscience and mind and heart so I never told you how much you‚Äôd done to me and hurt me over the years‚Ä¶ and you just left me and were in love again in a month‚Ä¶.  You didn‚Äôt treat me with respect..
And me, babu, the person who loved you so much for so many years.. 1.5 years later and I‚Äôm still nonstop crying in bed, unable to get up, dreaming of death, this is the saddest I‚Äôve ever felt, and i just dont know how you could do this to me.. You meant the world to me. I would have done anything for you. I loved you 8 years, you took 8 years of my life knowing I loved you all of it and you threw it without even discussion, and were already ready to marry someone else in 2 months.. That  is not respect :( I feel like trash that got thrown down the drain where i belong.. Babu I made you feel loved every single day of my life, and today, i cannot move. Today, day after day passes at work and i get nothing done.. My managers told me hes observed a big change and that i no longer stand out and am loosing my reputation.. I just cant breathe or think anymore.. On weekends, on fridays, im in bed by 6pm just laying there wishing my heart could stop and my brain could shut off.

Mama asked yesterday why her eid message to u didnt go n for me to have a look at whatsapp otherwise ull think she didnt message you eid this year and ull wonder why she didnt wish.. :( my mom cooked for u, shed buy halal chicken when we didnt have that much money n cooked extra just to make it special for u.. My aunt bought tandoori chicken extra knowing u lived there with me and that u were important to me.. 6 months.. Thats all she needed to get the respect and intent and promise of a future so she wouldnt have to feel unvalued and live in uncertainty‚Ä¶ the way i did for 8 years, waiting.. My mom often says that you remind her of my dad‚Ä¶ but no, my dad knew how to respect women. He did not reserve his respect and giving intent and value and making them feel secure only for others of his own religion. I guess I had to be muslim to receive all of those things‚Ä¶ you are nothing like him. You don‚Äôt respect women, you are worse than all those other muslim pakistani men, who think any woman but their muslim arranged marriage package woman deserves respect, intent, security. Any other woman a thing just to fuck, a placeholder to pass time and enjoy life with until its time to be serious and settledown. If a woman is not muslim, to disgusting backwards men, they do not deserve respect, that‚Äôs how you treated me anyway.

Smanu, you remember the video i sent u at the start of when u dumped me? I dont know if u did, my thumb and fingers shaking like a vibrator, i had a small stroke.. A transient ischemic attack ‚ÄúTIA‚Äù some months later. I didn‚Äôt want to tell you cause you‚Äôd think I‚Äôm old and unhealthy and bad health and never want to be with me. And honestly‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt even know how to tell you, I was blocked everywhere :( I told my mom it was work stress.. How could you do this to me and leave me like this without even being here. I thought if we ever did breakup, we‚Äôd still be best friends and love eachother. You were my family and you threw me away because I tried to leave you for years of you telling me you didnt love, want me, and werent gona give me a future.. I am not a switch.. Just cause out of the blue u change ur mind, i cant let go of everything in one second.. I just needed a few months cause i was so mad, even the london thing.. I was so mad‚Ä¶ one day we walked in the park and you‚Äôd already been leaving me alone so many days, and i talked about being married and the future and u did that same expression you do, like ur coughing and gona die.. And after i was already feeling like such shit, abandoned, worthless to you, hidden from ur friend, not a girl you were proud of to show off or tell anyone i was yours.. Then that.. I felt like the most worthless pathetic ugly shit girl alive. I was so hurt smanu and i let go and forgave you for all that. I even never told you how hurt i was cause the last thing i ever wanted to do, was make you feel sad. 


Smanu‚Ä¶ you were just my sunshine in life, it was so hard with my dad yelling all the time at home, hitting my mom, swearing, just everything, and i could just leave that and come sit at the desk and be back on our calls and be so happy hearing your voice. Every little text we shared, your voice, your jokes your songs for me.. You were my daily sunshine and I loved hugging you, I loved your voice, I loved the embarrassing dances you do. I just still even love you.
You were my sunshine, the one and only thing I had to smile for, and now the world is dark and empty, and I can never smile again.




My baby i don‚Äôt know i dont know anymore, i loved you. I just tried so hard to hate you, im not a switch i just hated you and suddenly wanted to move on after years of trying and trying, i loved you and i was hurt for years, so i wanted to move on cause i forced myself to hate u, and then u begged me back and u were everything i dreamed of and i was conflicted for 3-4 months i still felt desperate to leave you cause i was so scared of being hurt again i was so scared of loving you again. I just imagined leaving you and wanted to and i was so mad. And i was just trying to let go of that hate quietly. And i did, i just needed 3-4 months, I‚Äôm not a switch. It took my years and years to build up hate enough to help me walk away from you when years and years you were saying u didnt want me‚Ä¶ i needed just a little time and i wish u could forgive me for needing that time to let go of that anger and hrut and love you fully‚Ä¶ 

And i did, i let go of it, i loved you i loved  you, i forgave you. I put that hate and that want to leave away cause you finally loved me.
You don‚Äôt understand i went years and years of showing u that u were loved every single day of ur life. Tellign you i loved you every single day. I went years and years with you showing me i was unloved each of those days with your silence when id say it. I stayed through that, i waited for you to love me and i kept on loving you through it. You couldnt handle that for 3 months i didnt know if i loved you enough to want to go back to that potential pain. I was just hurt smanu. You put me through alot and i loved you and i forgave my baby, i forgave you cause i love you. We were so happy in banff and so in love, dreaming of bringing ur mom and mine there and i dont know what happened. Nothing happened inbetween then and u leaving, i didnt think of anyone else, i didnt say 1 thing bad on you, you left me for old messages and i dont know what to do.
I love you even now.
Please forgive me, please come back. I love you so much
Im drowning please, please you moved on so fast i didnt have a chance to make it up to you, to explain to tell you i loved you. You left me and in one month you were already in love with someone else.

I miss sitting on your lap and hugging you.. I miss hugging and holding onto your arm when youd shake me off.. I miss napping beside you, hugging you.. I miss your voice.. Your cheeks.. I miss u babu. You were a part of me.. My favorite and only happy part of me..

The world just went underwater so fast and i just sank and i cant breathe ever again and you‚Äôre gone. You left and you erased me and closed the book on us in under a month.. And i couldnt even have a chance to tell you how much you mean to me or beg me back, before i knew it you blocked me and told me its not fair to her. It all happened so quickly.. What about what was fair to me and our 8 years and all i gave up for you..
8 years is not comparable to 1.5 year.s. 1 year‚Ä¶ 1 month.. But still you threw me.. Like disgusting worthless pathetic trash, and thats just how i feel now. Pathetic and worthless, just waiting to die, unable to breathe.




Smanu I‚Äôve been holding onto so much hope‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been thinking how can the first girl he talks to after our 8 year relationship of being best friends who talk morning tonight for 8 years, where i never fought once, we never argued.. How could the first random girl he talks to not even a month after leaving me.. Really make him happy enough to want to propose‚Ä¶ 
I haven‚Äôt really even wanted to date at all thinking what if smanu changes his mind and comes back.. I‚Äôve just been hoping and waiting and wishing and crying and begging and praying‚Ä¶
But no‚Ä¶ within 6 months you really did get engaged..
Seeing it.. The engagement.. The bridal shower after.. I am so broken and sad.. It was so easy and quick for you to replace me and how much i loved and did for you and was loyal to you and dreamed of a life to you. Do you know what being loyal and loving to someone who repeatedly tells u that u are unloved and not gona be in their future for that many years feels like, how it hurts. I tried my best.. I then forgave everything.. Again i forgave without even wanting to tell you about any of it to not make you ever feel sad‚Ä¶
So if I can be this broken.. Had health issues.. Unable to do anything but cry and cant leave my bed.. Doing bad at work..
And you are so happy with your parties and your new beautiful bride u found within a few weeks‚Ä¶ the least you can do is atleast know fully, understand, and be aware of what you did to me babu, to someone who truly loved you so much and thought you would keep her safe and loved. 
Smanu I just, don‚Äôt know how to smile ever again, I feel like I haven‚Äôt smiled since you left. Any attempt feels hollow and empty and like the second i dont have to my face and heart is just sad again.. I feel like I haven‚Äôt done anything but fake smile while feeling like im dying inside.. I haven‚Äôt smiled since you left.

Anytime i try to do anything to help distract myself i cant even walk or enjoy trips iv been on without you being on the edge of every thought, id be in the best place, and the words in my mind is ‚Äúsmanu please come back‚Äù.. I cant take it anymore.. I just hate life and i hate myself even more..

Babu, I miss holding your hand in the car, dancing to barbie, sitting on your lap and hugging you, holding your arm when you shake it, singing songs, messaging u every second of every day, your voice. I miss loving you and feeling at home in your company. 
I don‚Äôt know, I feel like the ugliest most worthless girl a live.. If i were pretty, you would have been so proud, you would have never risked loosing me, never risked treating me like i was nothing.. Instead i was pathetic worthless trash, and i guess i got put where i belong..
I still start and end every day sobbing and weeping and unable to stop crying, saying to myself‚Äù please smanu come back.. I love you please..‚Äù for hours honestly.
Goodbye smanu, you are and always will be my love and my dreams. My tati pad babu. 
I miss you so much my angel, I think only of you, every hour you cross my mind.. I speak to my pretend you, the only comfort I get is your pretend voice I speak to, almost feels like I hear you. You‚Äôve been my everything for as long as I can remember. I wish I acted sooner, I just didn‚Äôt imagine within 2 months you‚Äôd already be in love, within one month you‚Äôd already be with someone else. I just never dreamt you‚Äôd block me within 2 months of leaving me and disappear from my life. I thought you‚Äôd be with me till I died.
I hope one day you‚Äôll understand how much I have done for you and how much I have loved you, forgiven for you, and cared for you. 
Love always,
Your little one.
